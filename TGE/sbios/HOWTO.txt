How Linux and SBIOS interacts:
##############################

SBIOS RPC functions return 0 on success.
Then the callback functions must be called.
When callback function is called with result 0 then RPC function will be called again for some functions like pad init.
This can be used to make more RPC calls if required.
When callback function is called with result 1 then RPC function call is finished.

SBIOS RPC functions return negative value on error.
Callback function must not be called.
