Linux patch: first 2 instructions of exception handler need to be nop and after
patched jump must be also a nop.

Fix initialisation of ATA/Network/PCI in loader. Currently PS2SDK code is
copied. Network frames can be send, but  not received. Hard disc is not working.

Function sbcall_cdvdtrayrequestStage2() is sometimes not called after RPC Call.
(When linux is working without debug then second RPC trayreq call leads to
deadlock.) RPC call message is transfered to IOP, when I replace the handler
with sceSifAddCmdHandler(0x8000000A, ...); the moment before, my handler is
executed. It seems that message is lost in RPC or CDVD module.
