0.6
- Get SIFRPC working in emulated ps2 kernel.
- Added support for negative syscalls (syscalls with first letter "i", which can
  be safely called in interrupt routines).
- Added support for semaphores in single thread environment including
  interrupts.
- Configured "Hello World!" as default example for emulated ps2 kernel.
0.5

- Added configure option in config.mk for selecting SBIOS type RTE or TGE.
- Added script that can extract the sbios.bin from PS2 Linux DVD 1.
- Implemented some functions of the sifcmd level.
- Extended my example kernel to emulate real PS2 kernel.
- Simple examples using graphic are working with emulated PS2 kernel.
- Use PS2 tutorial demo as example.
- Use "hello world" demo as second example.
- Changed DOS line endings to linux line endings.
- Fixed setup of stack in example kernel.
- Flush TLBs in example kernel.
- Map memory in example kernel like real PS2.
- Rewritten cache flush and invalidate functions.
- Handle some PS2 syscalls in example kernel.
- Added map files for analysing SBIOS, RTE PS2 linux loader and PS2 kernel.
- Added some syscall to emulated PS2 kernel.
- Added handling of INTC and DMAC to emulated PS2 kernel.
- Added timer interrupt handling to emulated PS2 kernel.
0.4
- Use gsKit for graphic output.
- Use normal malloc() instead of mempool.
0.3
- Use higher load address (maximum kernel size is now 5 MB).
- Set mempool automatically to the end of the elf file.
- Disable RPC DMA channel before starting linux.
- Fix problem in exception handler that leads to random bus errors and page faults (at 0x80000204 must be a "nop" instruction).
- Setup some cp0 registers, just to be sure.

0.2
- Removed graphic support in loader.
- Added support to use iop printf over shared memory.
- Output is redireceted via ps2link.
- Modules loaded from host and iop is reset before starting kernel.
