2.5
- Fixed CDVD problems in Linux 2.2. This allows to install
  Sony's Linux Toolkit with kernelloader.
- Automatically create save game icon when saving configuration
  file in mc0:kloader/ or mc1:kloader/. Linux mascot created by
  Larry Ewing.
- Fixed bug in SBIOS when pointer is not aligned in RPC call.
  This error normally never happens.
- Devided kernel parameters into video parameters and other
  kernel parameters in menu.
- Support video parameters for framebuffer driver of Linux2.6
- Fix detecting of console region on v12/v13 SCPH-7000x. This
  should fix DVD video support on these consoles. This is
  needed to get the Live DVD working.
- Added mode setting by function keys:
  F1: Auto detect
  F2: VGA 640x480 60Hz
  F3: VGA 640x480 72Hz
  F4: VGA 640x480 75Hz
  F5: VGA 640x480 85Hz
  F6: DTV 480P
  F7: NTSC
  F8: PAL
- Disabled switching of screen mode with keys "+" and "-" in
  input fields, because the keys can be used as kernel parameters
  and switching can confuse the user.
- The screen was scrolling away in loader when there was no game pad
  connected to port 0. Fixed detecting of game pads.
- Add parameter "-d" for kernelloader. This enables loading of
  ps2link for debugging purpose.
- Show blinking cursor in input fields. Add possibilty to navigate
  the cursor with the cursor keys.
- Set scroll position to 0 when input field is opened.
- Changed screenshot button to R3.
- Added virtual keyboard. The key is selected with R1 and L1.
  The triangle button inserts the key. Left and right moves the
  cursor left and right. The square button deletes a character
  and the circle button is for fast jumping in key selection.
  The start button jumps to the beginning and the select button
  to the end of the string.

2.4
- Add support for 64 bit kernels.
- Add support for Linux 2.6 initial RAM disk parameters (initrd).
- Fix alignment in SIF command interrupt handler. This could
  randomly freeze drivers. Which could freeze the whole
  system. Kernelloader should now support more kernels like
  the NetBSD kernel.

2.3
- Fix crash when bad configuration file is loaded.
- Fix for power button. System will shutdown when power button
  is pressed.

2.2
- Screen position can be changed with the left analog stick
  within kernelloader. Don't expect any effect in Linux. In
  Linux you need to use the new setcrtmode from CVS.
- Fixed pink screen problem with component signal (YPbPr)
- Fixed problems with VGA signal.
- Added better BSD Support (still not fully working).
- Reworked code (mainly debug code, sharedmem.irx).
- Buttons L2 and R2 select the screen mode within
  kernelloader (VESA, 480P, NTSC or PAL). 480P may
  have problems on the right side of the screen, I can't
  test this.
- The keys "+" and "-" on a connected USB keyboard switch the
  screen mode. On the US layout the keys are left to the
  delete key (sign < X |). For "+" you need to press the SHIFT
  key at the same time. If you don't have an US keyboard, the
  keys may have differnt signs on it.
  For details see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout
- Add auto detection of sound modules from rom1.
- Add menu for showing versions of PS2 ROM, rom1:LIBSD, hardware
  and kernelloader.
- Don't show error if HDD adapter is not connected.
- Added unionfs-1.0.14 to kernel patches. This is required to
  get a full featured live DVD (write support).

2.1
- Disable DVD access if loading of eromdrvloader.irx failed.
- Added DNS client which supports TCP connections only.
- Added support for downloading files from internet (HTTP).
  Instead of a file name a URL can be specified (for example:
  http://www.server.com/filename). The DNS server need to be
  configured in the net options menu.
- Added patch for libsd which enables USB support when using
  sound modules from RTE with newer slim PSTwo (v15). This patch
  may not be required, because it is solved by enabling USB
  from EE instead of IOP side. So the patch is by default disabled.
- Read DVD region from NVM. This should work at least with
  SCPH-77004. eromdrvloader.irx error should be fixed (I can't
  test this).
- Moved USB initialisation from EE to IOP CPU. This makes USB more
  stable on slim PSTwo.
- Fixed bug in SBIOS code for MC. The bug caused system to hang
  if the XMCMAN and XMCSERV modules are used or on heavy USB usage
  on slim PSTwo.
- Fixed bug in SBIOS code for PAD. The bug caused system to hang
  suddenly (mostly at startup) if XPADMAN is used.
- By default the new modules are used on slim PSTwo. This makes USB
  more stable. Sometimes there are wrong data written to USB memory
  devices on slim PSTwo.
- Add ability to reload modules in kernelloader (to activate a changed
  network configuration).
- Add SBIOS call for reading burned DVD video discs. This allows to
  run live Linux DVDs. A patched Linux kernel is required to use the
  new SBIOS call (vmlinux_fat_and_slim_v4.gz).
- Fixed detection of wrong console type at startup if no configuration
  was loaded from memory card.

2.0
- Updated to PS2SDK SVN Revision 1601.
- Updated to gsKit SVN Revision 1588.
- Fixed PAL/NTSC detection on slim PSTwo.
- Fixed ethernet on slim PSTwo (smaprpc.irx + Linux patch).
- Initialize fat PS2 dev9 from IOP side (ethernet + hdd, dev9init.irx).
- Easier menu
- Added menu entry "Restore defaults" in "File Menu". This will restore all defaults except the kernel and initrd path.
- Detect slim PSTwo or fat PS2 automatically if no configuration was loaded or if "Restore defaults" is selected.
- I don't know if auto detection is working for fat PS2 V11 (SCPH-5000?). I have a SCPH-50004 with ROM version 0190, but I am not sure if it is V10 or V11. I choosed ROM version 0190 as last fat PS2 version.
- There should be less problems with USB sticks in kernelloader.

1.9
- Support interrupts on slim PSTwo. So USB is working.
- Support automatic boot (without key or button press).
- Stop sound engine when kernelloade starts.
- Add possibilty to extract RTE modules and SBIOS to memory card.
- RTE modules and SBIOS can now be loaded from memory card.
- USB module can be replaced by one on memory card.
- Automatic boot feature (time out)
- Added audsrv.irx sound module.
- Added free versions of padman, sio2man and libsd.
- Fixed Video DVD support on slim PSTwo (rom1:EROMDRV? detection)

1.8
- Support video DVDs in kernelloader, for reading Linux kernel and initrd.
- Support for compressed kernels to save space on PS2 memory card.
- Verify ELF file integrity before starting the kernel. Broken files caused
  by failed downloads will be detected.
- Fixed bug when trying to load small kernels and initrd. Print error message
  when this happens. Initrd must be deactivated when using the example
  kernel included in kloader.elf.
- Add possibilty to select different config files.
- Automatically load cdfs:config.txt if found.

1.7
- Enabled screenshot feature. Screenshot in kernelloader can be done by
  pressing button "R1". Screenshot is saved on USB memory stick.
- Allow only one RPC call at the same time. This fixed CDVD bug.
- Allow to set graphic mode. Implementation of function setdve is still missing.
- Fixed memory hole when SifSetDma() is currently not possible in
  SifCallRpc() and SifbindRpc().
- Cleanup return codes when SBIOS call need to be retried later.

  Disable IOP debug output.

1.4
- Added menu entry for reboot to enter PS2 browser.
- Fixed auto detect of PCIC type for SCPH-10350.

	0: No card
	1: PCMCIA
	2: PCMCIA
	3: SCPH-10350 with PHY 83847A and MAC CXD9731GP.
	Empty: Auto detect

1.3
- Emulated ps2 kernel can now be loaded by Sony PS2 linux.
- Get hard disc runnning, but without interrupts. Access is very slow.

1.2
- Fixed out of VRAM in NTSC mode.
- Added code for making screenshots. Code is unstable, so I deactivated it.

1.1
- Better graphical look and style of boot screen.
- Fixed error when switching mc directories to often.
- Autodetect memory card module version in SBIOS.
- Fixed problem that debug output was lost in eedebug.irx.
- Needed to move load address of kernelloader from 5 MB to ~4 MB,
  because kernel has problems with initrd loaded at a high address.
  Maximum kernel size is ~4 MB.
- Check ELF files for correct section location before startin. Can be
  deactivated in menu ("Enable IOP debug output").
- Print debug output on screen when kernelloader is started.
- Added USB keyboard support in kernelloader, you can select menu
  by using CURSOR KEYS and RETURN.
- Kernel parameter can be changed with USB keyboard.

1.0
- Added support for CDVD (Playstation CD and Playstation DVD can be read).
- Finished dmarelay.irx, I am unsure about the correctness of function
  read_thread() in the ATA part.

  configuration.
- Ethernet frames can be send, but not received.
- Hard disc is not yet working.
