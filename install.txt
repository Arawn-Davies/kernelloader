Kernelloader for ps2 Linux
##########################

This program can load a Linux kernel and start it. You need Linux kernel
2.4.17 for ps2 from the sony website. To build it you need a Linux host
and the PS2SDK. You also need to get a mips cross compiler. You can
download it here:

Download linux-2.4.17_ps2.tar.bz2 from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelloader/files/Linux%202.4/Linux%202.4.17%20Kernel%20Source/linux-2.4.17_ps2.tar.bz2/download

Toolchain:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelloader/files/Sony%20Linux%20Toolkit/Package%20Update%20Files/ps2stuff/gcc-2.95.2-cross.tar.gz/download
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelloader/files/Sony%20Linux%20Toolkit/Package%20Update%20Files/ps2stuff/binutils-2.9EE-cross.tar.gz/download

initrd:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelloader/files/Sony%20Linux%20Toolkit/Package%20Update%20Files/diskless/ps2boot-1.tar.gz/download

You can also download the updated initrd at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelloader/files/Initial%20RAM%20Disc/

Install Linux toolchain:

sh # sudo tar -xzf gcc-2.95.2-cross.tar.gz -C /usr/local
sh # sudo tar -xzf binutils-2.9EE-cross.tar.gz -C /usr/local


sh # tar -xjf linux-2.4.17_ps2.tar.bz2 
sh # cd linux-2.4.17_ps2

There is no patch required to start Linux.

The following patch and files are recommended to get around many problems:

sh # patch -p1 <../kernelloader/patches/linux-2.4.17_ps2-all_fat_and_slim.patch
sh # patch -p1 <../kernelloader/patches/linux-2.4.17_ps2-no-bwlinux-check.patch
sh # cp ../kernelloader/driver_slim_smaprpc/smaprpc.c drivers/ps2/
sh # cp ../kernelloader/driver_slim_smaprpc/smaprpc.h drivers/ps2/
sh # cp -r ../kernelloader/driver_ps2fs/ps2fs fs/
sh # cp -r ../kernelloader/driver_unionfs/unionfs fs/

You can add support for printk over ps2link by patching Linux (system
start is slower, this is not recommended for normal user):

sh # patch -p1 <../kernelloader/patches/linux-2.4.17_ps2-printk.patch

Then set the toolchain:

sh # echo "/usr/local/ps2/bin/ee-" >.hhl_cross_compile-mips-r5900
sh # ./setup-ps2


Status: Kerneloader has a on screen menu. Debug information is
printed using ps2link, when it is enabled in config.mk. Kernel is starting,
most stuff is working including graphic, USB, hard disc and network.
USB is unstable with v14 or higher slim PSTwo. Sound need old module
version available on old games or in old rom1.

INSTALL:
First you need to compile ps2smap and ps2link from ps2dev and copy the
modules "ps2smap.irx" and "ps2link.irx" to the directory "$PS2SDK/iop/irx/".
Then run make for a test (You should change the ip address in
"loader/Makefile" and in "loader/loader.c" variable "ifcfg"):

PS2SDK
######
To compile kernelloader you need PS2SDK, if you don't use it already
install it as follows:

sh # git clone https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain.git
sh # cd ps2toolchain
sh # git checkout ae6f9c003c98470040e78cec739ea86a49de2a39
sh # sudo bash ./toolchain.sh
sh # cd ..

After this you need to compile a patched version of ps2sdk:
sh # git clone https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk.git
sh # cd ps2sdk
sh # git checkout 38267d0159d686b6e424221ccc2f3cea80b21f8c
sh # patch -p0 <../kernelloader/patches/ps2sdk-readnvm.patch
sh # make
sh # sudo make install
sh # cd ..

USB
###
You need also to install the usb driver:

svn.ps2dev.org is not available, so you need to use the mirror:

sh # svn co -r 1601 http://psp.jim.sh/svn/ps2/trunk/usb_mass

sh # cd usb_mass
sh # cd iop
sh # make
sh # sudo cp usb_mass.irx /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/iop/irx
sh # cd ..

STL
###
STL is used and need to be installed:
sh # git clone https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk-ports/stlport.git
sh # cd ps2sdk-ports
sh # git checkout 256d65f916d974d79a382e118be365b62273c9ac

sh # cd stlport
sh # make
sh # sudo make install
sh # cd ..

ZLIB
####
ZLIB need to be installed:
sh # cd zlib
sh # make
sh # sudo make install
sh # cd ..
sh # cd ..

PS2LINK
#######
If you want to debug something then you also need ps2link, but the
following steps are not required, when you don't activate it in
config.mk.

sh # git clone https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2eth.git
sh # cd ps2eth
sh # git checkout 2eb548cea263995f35b5bb0a2451a96871a59994
sh # make
sh # sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2eth/smap/
sh # sudo cp smap/ps2smap.irx /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2eth/smap/
sh # cd ..
sh # https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2link.git
sh # cd ps2link
sh # git checkout 3c6c81637293b93edd1af23f6c0f501af9948352
sh # make

It may stop with an error that ps2-packer is missing. It is not
needed to build it completely. Just continue:

sh # sudo cp iop/ps2link.irx /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/iop/irx/
sh # cd ..

To further compile someting for PS2SDK, you need to setup the environment:
export PS2DEV="/usr/local/ps2dev"
export PS2SDK="$PS2DEV/ps2sdk"
export PS2LIB="$PS2SDK"
export PATH="${PS2DEV}/bin:${PS2DEV}/ee/bin:${PS2DEV}/iop/bin:${PS2DEV}/dvp/bin:${PS2DEV}/ps2sdk/bin:$PATH"

You need also to set up where your source code is:
export PS2_SRC_PREFIX=$HOME/ps2src
You need to adjust it to your prefered path.
export PS2SDKSRC="${PS2_SRC_PREFIX}/ps2sdk"
export GSKITSRC="${PS2_SRC_PREFIX}/gsKit"
export PS2ETH="${PS2_SRC_PREFIX}/ps2eth"

GSKIT
#####
The graphic library is used for displaying everything. You need to install it:
sh # cd $PS2_SRC_PREFIX
sh # git clone https://github.com/ps2dev/gsKit.git
sh # cd gsKit
sh # git checkout 946922b3c15498b3c1a36203195964ddf2fe46e7
sh # make
sh # make install

SJCRUNCH
########
sjcrunch is a packer for PS2 elf files. This is required to get smaller
file size and to get a version which can be booted by Action Replay
Media Player.

sh # cd $PS2SDKSRC
sh # wget http://sksapps.com/mis/sjcrunch-2.1.zip
sh # mkdir sjcrunch
sh # cd sjcrunch
sh # unzip ../sjcrunch-2.1.zip
sh # cd pc

On new Linux systems the program need to be patched:

sh # patch -p0 <../../kernelloader/patches/sjcrunch_lzo2.patch

sh # make
sh # cd ..
sh # cp pc/sjcrunch_packer script
sh # cd script
sh # sudo (sed <sjcrunch -e s-SJCRUNCH_PATH=.*-SJCRUNCH_PATH=$(pwd)- -e s-SJCRUNCH_PACKER=.*-SJCRUNCH_PACKER=\$SJCRUNCH_PATH/sjcrunch_packer- >/usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/bin/sjcrunch)
sh # sudo chmod +x /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/bin/sjcrunch

Kernelloader
############
To compile kernelloader you need some additional libraries on your host:

- libpng

You need to check that you have the development package installed (on debian suffix "-dev", on SuSe "devel")

Now you can go back to kernelloader for a test:

sh # make

The following test will upload the elf file using ps2link. ps2link must
be started on the PS2. You can also use your prefered upload method. The
elf file "kloader.elf" can also be started by AR Max Media Player. You need
just to copy it on a USB memory stick.

sh # make test

A menu will start and you can select the first menu entry by pressing the
CROSS button on the first pad.
You should see the output of example kernel on screen. The kernel
tries to emulate the original PS2 kernel and start a graphic demo. SIFRPC
is working correctly in this kernel. All IOP hardware should work. Only
single thread and a interrupt handler is supported.

Linux
#####
Now you should compile the Linux kernel. Run menu config and deactivate
old bootinfo support.

The easiest way is, if you copy the configuration:

sh # cp ../kernelloader/kernelconfig .config

This includes much stuff into the kernel.

But you can also do it manually and configure only required options:

sh # make menuconfig

Deactivate "Machine selection"  ---> "Support for old style boot information"
Activate "Machine selection"  ---> "Support for PS2 Memory Card File System" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "Block devices" ---> "RAM disk support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "Block devices" ---> "Initial RAM disk (initrd) support"
Activate "File systems" ---> "ISO 9660 CDROM file system support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "File systems" ---> "Second extended fs support" (choose "*" and not "M")

Slim PSTwo needs access to USB devices:
Activate "SCSI Support" ---> "SCSI Support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "SCSI Support" ---> "SCSI disk support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "USB support" ---> "USB Mass storage support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "File Systems" ---> "DOS FAT fs support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "File Systems" ---> "MSDOS fs support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "File Systems" ---> "VFAT (Windows-95) fs support" (choose "*" and not "M")

Recommended:
Activate "Console drivers" ---> "Frame-buffer support" ---> "Console scrollback support"
Activate "File systems" ---> "PS2 file system support" (choose "*" and not "M")
Activate "Union filesystem support" ---> "PS2 file system support" (choose "M" and not "*")

DHCP support:
Activate "Networking Options" ---> "Socket Filtering"

Save configuration and then run:

sh # make dep
sh # make
sh # make modules

You should strip it, to reduce loading time and to prevent out of memory errors (less than 12MB available).
sh # /usr/local/ps2/bin/ee-strip vmlinux

You can compress the file:
sh # gzip vmlinux

You need to copy the file "linux-2.4.17_ps2/vmlinux.gz" on a ps2 memory card
or a USB memory stick and insert it into your PS2.

Initrd
######
The initrd includes the Linux file system. This required for installing
Linux.

Make an "initrd.gz":

Extract "ps2boot-1.tar.gz" as root user.

Generate "initrd.gz" as root user.

sh # ./mkbootcd.sh

Then copy "initrd.gz" to "kernelloader/loader".

sh # cp initrd.gz ../kernelloader/loader/

Kernelloader
############
Go back to kernelloader dir and run make test again.

sh # make test

Maximum size of kernel is ~4 MB.
The loader sets maximum "initrd.gz" decompressed size to 16 MB (using
"ramdisk_size=16384").
The Linux kernel should start. USB keyboard is working. You can also
load the kernel from a memory card or a USB memory stick. You can select
the file in the menu in the kernelloader on the PS2 using the first pad
or the "+" and "-" keys on a connected USB keyboard.

Remarks:
########

You can select the SBIOS type "TGE" or "RTE" if you have DISC 1 from Sony's
Linux (for PlayStation 2) Release 1.0. To start Linux this is not required.
TGE is not finished and it is possible that "RTE" is running more stable.
Then you need to put in the original PS2 Linux DVD DISC 1 and adjust the
path in config.mk. The SBIOS will be automatically extracted. Linux will
only start with this version when you change the configuration accordingly:

When kernelloader is started you need to do the following:
1. Uncheck "Enable TGE (disable RTE)" in "Configuration Menu".
2. Execute "Submit above config" in "Configuration Menu".
3. Uncheck "Use SBIOS from TGE (ow RTE)".
4. Uncheck all CDVD entries in "Enabled SBIOS Calls" menu which is
located in "Configuration Menu" (entries 176 to 195).

With this configuration USB keyboard seems only to work when it is not
plugged in at startup.

USB is only working when ps2link modules are not loaded (see "Configuration Menu").
It is also possible to select new ROM modules instead of old ones.

CDVD calls should also be disabled when using TGE, because of some Linux
kernel exceptions.

Files with prefix "host:" a first searched in a kloader.elf embedded
files system.
