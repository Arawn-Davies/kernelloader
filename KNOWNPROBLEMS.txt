PR#1 - Solved by workaround.
Fix initialisation of ATA/Network/PCI in loader. Currently PS2SDK code is
copied. Network frames can be send, but  not received. Hard disc is not working.
-
Update: Hard disc is now working slowly without interrupts.
-
Update: Network is now working.
-
Update: Hard disc is now working fast with interrupts.
-
Update: IRX modules need to be loaded before when hard disc should work.
-
Update: IRX modules are automatically loaded when kernelloader starts.

PR#2 - Solved by workaround
Function sbcall_cdvdtrayrequestStage2() is sometimes not called after RPC Call.
(When linux is working without debug then second RPC trayreq call leads to
deadlock.) RPC call message is transfered to IOP, when I replace the handler
with sceSifAddCmdHandler(0x8000000A, ...); the moment before, my handler is
executed. It seems that message is lost in RPC or CDVD module.
-
Update: Changed SBIOS to allow maximum 1 rpc call or bind at the same time.
Working with old ROM module, not working with new one.

PR#3 - Solved
Reset is not working when loaded by ps2link.
-
Problem is based on old ps2link version.
-
Update: poweroff.irx is now loaded by kernelloader. Power off is working.

PR#4 - Solved
Memory card is not working when new modules are loaded from ROM.
-
Update: Fixed.

PR#5 - Solved by workaround
CDVD driver version is not detected by TGE SBIOS.
-
You need to choose SBIOS version in kernelloader menu.

PR#6 - Solved by workaround
PAD driver version is not detected by TGE SBIOS.
-
You need to choose SBIOS version in kernelloader menu.

PR#7 - Solved
Initrd must be loaded to low memory address.
-
Update: This is automatically done. But if loading fails and you try it again, it
is possible that initrd is loaded to higher address (see PR#10).
-
Initrd is now loaded and copied later to lower memory address behind kernel.

PR#8 - Solved
Network can only send, but not receive.
-
Network is working with SCPH-10350 and SCPH-10281.
DMA is currently not supported. Linux 2.4.17 driver binds to different RPC server.
But it seems that Sony never delivered any responsible IOP module.

PR#9 - Solved
Hard disc can't be used.
-
Update: Hard disc is too slow, interrupts are not working.
-
Update: Hard disc is now working without DMA. But it seems that Sony never
delivered any responsible IOP module.
-
Update: Some IRX modules (ps2link)  need to be loaded once before.
-
Update: IRX modules are now loaded by kernelloader.

PR#10 - Solved
When loading of Linux failed, because file names where wrong and this is fixed
after. Then it is possible that the initrd is loaded at a higher address, which
leads to segmentation faults when starting system later.
-
Fixed in linux initrd patch.

PR#11 - Solved
New ROM modules and TGE version with support for it leads to linux panic:
Scheduling in interrupt.
-
Currently it leads to strange exceptions at startup
-
Module padman is responsible for this. You need to disable padman or need to use
padman.irx from RTE.
-
IOP heap bug fixed solved some problems, but it is not yet working.
-
Only working if XMCMAN.IRX, XMCSERV.IRX and XPADMAN.IRX is not loaded.
At least padman.irx from RTE is working.
-
Update: Only XPADMAN.IRX should not be loaded.
-
Update: Fixed SBIOS code for XPADMAN.IRX. New modules are now working.

PR#12 - Workaround
USB is not working with V12 and higher slim PSTwo console. This was
reported in ps2dev forums. I don't have a slim PS2, so I can't test it.
-
Go to "File Menu" and select "Restore defaults".
Then a Linux kernel with a patch is required (linux-2.4.17_ps2-rpc-irq.patch).

PR#13 - Solved
Game controller (pad) is not working in linux.
-
You need to disable IOP debug output and eedebug.irx in kernelloader menu.

PR#14 - Solved
Kernel crashs after shutdown. This is uncritical, because it happens after
unmounting all partitions. This should be fixed when CDVD is working.
-
Update: Power off is now working.

PR#15
When you insert a USB device while booting before Linux kernel starts, the system crashs.

PR#16
NetBSD graphic is not working
-
You need to set in the kernelloader menu the graphic mode to 4. The function setdve is
not finished. NetBSD can only work in VGA mode, but VGA mode is not supported.

PR#17 - Solved by workaround
Linux is not starting when eedebug.irx is loaded.
-
You need also to activate IOP debug output or disable the module.

PR#18 - Solved
After mounting CD or DVD the shutdown is not working
-
This should work now.

PR#19
pad: sbcall_padinfomode and sbcall_padinfoact make RPC calls when old rom modules used.
This can lead to a failure and system can be blocked.

PR#20
Sometimes hard disc interrupts are lost (hard disc will do nothing for some seconds).

PR#21 - Solved by workaround
Only kernels upto 6 MB are supported, because zlib is used for loading. Kernel size is
not known until everything is extracted. The progress bar shows the complete available
memory, when loading the kernel.
-
You need to strip the kernel using program "ee-strip".

PR#22
Sound is not working.
-
Sound is only owkring with the modules from RTE. Put in the disc from RTE and go to
the "Configuration Menu" -> "RTE Copy Menu" and select "Copy RTE modules". This
will copy the RTE modules from the disc to the memory card.
Then go up and select "Module List". You need to enable:
mc0:kloader/libsd.irx
mc0:kloader/sdrdrv.irx

PR#23 - Solved
USB is not working if sound modules of RTE are loaded.
-
You need to enable the patch for libsd.
-
Update no patch is needed. It should work always.

PR#24
USB is unstable with slim PSTwo (v15 and higher).
-
There is somewhere a deadlock. This is diffcult to debug.
-
Update: System is not crashing when using new modules, but wrong
data may be written to USB.

PR#25 - Solved
Region detection is not working. The result is that eromdrvloader.irx can't be
loaded.
-
The workaround currently is to use a european slim PSTwo or a old fat PS2 or
slim PSTwo (v12).
-
Added auto detection. This hasn't been tested, but should work.

PR#26
If loading of kernel fails, the configuration can't be saved. The file is destroyed.
Menu entry "Reboot" is not working.

PR#27
DNS over UDP is not working.
-
Only DNS over TCP is working. You need to use different name server.

PR#28 - Solved
Downloading from webserver not working after changing the IP configuration (DNS, Gateway).
-
You need to reboot. The IP configuration becomes valid after reboot.
-
Added menu entry for reloading IRX modules, no reboot needed.

PR#29
Kernelloader is not starting or Linux is not starting if no DVD is inserted.
-
You need to insert a PS2 compatible disc and close the tray.

PR#30
Network is not working in kernelloader or system is hanging at startup.
-
You need to connect the network cable before starting kernelloader.
