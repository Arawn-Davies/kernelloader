PR#1 - Solved by workaround.
Fix initialisation of ATA/Network/PCI in loader. Currently PS2SDK code is
copied. Network frames can be send, but  not received. Hard disc is not working.
-
Update: Hard disc is now working slowly without interrupts.
-
Update: Network is now working.
-
Update: Hard disc is now working fast with interrupts.
-
Update: IRX modules need to be loaded before when hard disc should work.
-
Update: IRX modules are automatically loaded when kernelloader starts.

PR#2 - Solved by workaround
Function sbcall_cdvdtrayrequestStage2() is sometimes not called after RPC Call.
(When linux is working without debug then second RPC trayreq call leads to
deadlock.) RPC call message is transfered to IOP, when I replace the handler
with sceSifAddCmdHandler(0x8000000A, ...); the moment before, my handler is
executed. It seems that message is lost in RPC or CDVD module.
-
Update: Changed SBIOS to allow maximum 1 rpc call or bind at the same time.
Working with old ROM module, not working with new one.

PR#3 - Solved
Reset is not working when loaded by ps2link.
-
Problem is based on old ps2link version.
-
Update: poweroff.irx is now loaded by kernelloader. Power off is working.

PR#4
Memory card is not working when new modules are loaded from ROM.

PR#5
CDVD driver version is not detected by TGE SBIOS.
-
You need to choose SBIOS version in kernelloader menu.

PR#6
PAD driver version is not detected by TGE SBIOS.
-
You need to choose SBIOS version in kernelloader menu.

PR#7 - Solved
Initrd must be loaded to low memory address.
-
Update: This is automatically done. But if loading fails and you try it again, it
is possible that initrd is loaded to higher address (see PR#10).
-
Initrd is now loaded and copied later to lower memory address behind kernel.

PR#8 - Solved
Network can only send, but not receive.
-
Network is at working with SCPH-10350 and SCPH-10281.
DMA is currently not supported. Linux 2.4.17 driver binds to different RPC server.
But it seems that Sony never delivered any responsible IOP module.

PR#9 - Solved
Hard disc can't be used.
-
Update: Hard disc is too slow, interrupts are not working.
-
Update: Hard disc is now working without DMA. But it seems that Sony never
delivered any responsible IOP module.
-
Update: Some IRX modules (ps2link)  need to be loaded once before.
-
Update: IRX modules are now loaded by kernelloader.

PR#10 - Solved
When loading of Linux failed, because file names where wrong and this is fixed
after. Then it is possible that the initrd is loaded at a higher address, which
leads to segmentation faults when starting system later.
-
Fixed in linux initrd patch.

PR#11
New ROM modules and TGE version with support for it leads to linux panic:
Scheduling in interrupt.
-
Currently it leads to strange exceptions at startup
-
Module padman is responsible for this. You need to disable padman or need to use
padman.irx from RTE.
-
IOP heap bug fixed solved some problems, but it is not yet working.
-
Only working if XMCMAN.IRX, XMCSERV.IRX and XPADMAN.IRX is not loaded.
At least padman.irx from RTE is working.

PR#12 - Workaround
USB is not working with V12 and higher slim PSTwo console. This was
reported in ps2dev forums. I don't have a slim PS2, so I can't test it.
-
slim PSTwo need to be selected in module configuration and must be submitted.
Then a Linux kernel with a patch is required (linux-2.4.17_ps2-rpc-irq.patch).

PR#13
Game controller (pad) is not working in linux.
-
You need to disable IOP debug output and eedebug.irx in kernelloader menu.

PR#14 - Solved
Kernel crashs after shutdown. This is uncritical, because it happens after
unmounting all partitions. This should be fixed when CDVD is working.
-
Update: Power off is now working.

PR#15
When you insert a USB device while booting before Linux kernel starts, the system crashs.

PR#16
NetBSD graphic is not working
-
You need to set in the kernelloader menu the graphic mode to 4. The function setdve is
not finished. NetBSD can only work in VGA mode, but VGA mode is not supported.

PR#17 - Solved by workaround
Linux is not starting when eedebug.irx is loaded.
-
You need also to activate IOP debug output or disable the module.

PR#18
After mounting CD or DVD the shutdown is not working

PR#19
pad: sbcall_padinfomode and sbcall_padinfoact make RPC calls when old rom modules used.
This can lead to a failure and system can be blocked.

PR#20
Sometimes hard disc interrupts are lost (hard disc will do nothing for some seconds).

PR#21
Only kernels upto 6 MB are supported, because zlib is used for loading. Kernel size is
not known until everything is extracted. The progress bar shows the complete available
memory, when loading the kernel.
-
You need to strip the kernel using program "ee-strip".
