PR#1
Fix initialisation of ATA/Network/PCI in loader. Currently PS2SDK code is
copied. Network frames can be send, but  not received. Hard disc is not working.

PR#2
Function sbcall_cdvdtrayrequestStage2() is sometimes not called after RPC Call.
(When linux is working without debug then second RPC trayreq call leads to
deadlock.) RPC call message is transfered to IOP, when I replace the handler
with sceSifAddCmdHandler(0x8000000A, ...); the moment before, my handler is
executed. It seems that message is lost in RPC or CDVD module.

PR#3
Reset is not working when loaded by ps2link.

PR#4
Memory card is not working when new module is loaded from ROM.

PR#5
CDVD driver version is not detected by TGE SBIOS.

PR#6
PAD driver version is not detected by TGE SBIOS.

PR#7
Initrd must be loaded to low memory address.

PR#8
Network can only send, but not receive.

PR#9
Hard disc can't be used.

PR#10
When loading of Linux failed, because file names where wrong and this is fixed
after. Then it is possible that the initrd is loaded at a higher address, which
leads to segmentation faults when starting system later.

PR#11
New ROM modules and TGE version with support for it leads to linux panic:
Scheduling in interrupt.
